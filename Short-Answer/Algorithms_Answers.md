#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)Linear becase there is only one loop and no more loops or recursion within it. O(n)

b)Quadratic because there a nested loop that will make a whole loop pass for each outer loop pass. o(n^2)

c)Linear because it's recursion it's from one function call therefore the increase of n will result in one more function call. O(n)

## Exercise II
